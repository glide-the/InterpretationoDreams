As most LLMs are based on Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017), which is a typical memoryintensive architecture. The inference bottleneck lies more in the GPU\u2019s memory bandwidth, hence reducing its memory access can significantly improve the inference speed. FlashAttention (Dao et al. 2022), DeepSpeed (Aminabadi et al. 2022), and FlexGen (Sheng et al. 2023) propose optimized transformer implementations or efficient memory management to improve the throughput of LLMs. Others achieve this goal through model pruning, such as LoSparse (Li et al. 2023), SparseGPT (Frantar and Alistarh 2023), and LLM-Pruner (Ma, Fang, and Wang 2023). MiniMoE (Zhang et al. 2023) obtains smaller models with high performance through distillation.  \n\nPost-training Quantization. Weight-only quantization schemes like GPTQ (Frantar et al. 2022) compresses and stores weight parameters, and decompresses them to FP16 for inference during calculation. This approach can effectively reduce the proportion of memory access time during inference while maintaining model accuracy. LLM.int8() (Dettmers et al. 2022) proposes to use float calculation or to adjust the multiplication operations of LayerNorm to reduce quantization loss. Smoothquant (Xiao et al. 2023) proposes a method to reduce the activation ranges by equivalently transferring the multiplication factors in weights and activations. GPTQ (Frantar et al. 2022) reconstruct weights based on the method in OBS (Hassibi, Stork, and Wolff 1993) via Hessian matrix to reduce quantization error. GPTQ has been widely applied in many scenarios where some LLMs could achieve high precision at 4-bit quantization. RPTQ (Yuan et al. 2023) and AWQ (Lin et al. 2023) further improve this method.  \n\nQuantization-aware Training. Another method to improve the performance of the quantized models is quantization-aware training (QAT), which is to fine-tune the quantized models to match the original float models. QAT is widely studied in convolutional networks, but it encounters significant setbacks in large language model quantization. As the training process of LLMs consumes a huge amount of text data (usually in the order of trillions of tokens), how to efficiently fine-tune the quantized LLMs while maintaining their general knowledge and generalization ability remains an open question. To name a few attempts, LLM-QAT (Liu et al. 2023) requires the update the whole parameters of the LLMs on a set of at least $100\\\\mathrm{k}$ sampled data. ZeroQuantV2 (Yao et al. 2023) introduces a Low Rank Compensation to achieve parameter-efficient fine-tuning, but this approach neither eliminates the need for a large amount of training data nor avoids the introduction of additional parameters.\n\n# Method\n\n# Motivation\nBased on the observation shown in Figure 1, the difference between the output tensors of each layer in the quantized model and its floating counterpart accumulates, while the output of the quantized model gradually deviates from the quantization-friendly zero-mean distribution. This is somewhat expected since LayerNorm magnifies the outlier (Xiao et al. 2023) and no measure is taken to deal with this effect. Hence when we iteratively update the quantized weights of each layer using GPTQ, it inevitably disrupts the zero-mean distribution of the current layer and increases the deviation.  \n\nTo this end, we aim to improve the quantized model\u2019s performance by adjusting its output distribution to approach that of its float counterpart. Complete fine-tuning of the quantized model through QAT is a direct approach, but the large number of parameters in the LLM model and the huge amount of required training data make QAT unacceptable. In order to achieve high performance the quantized model within the time constraint, we are driven to improve current PTQ methods. As LayerNorm is very handy to manipulate distribution, we choose to adjust this layer to achieve the goal. It is also economical to update its weight considering the small number of parameters. Furthermore, nearly all mainstream LLMs use LayerNorm or similar operators, so that the method can be applied universally to a variety of large language models. Therefore, our core objective can be summarized as adjusting the parameters of LayerNorm to make the output distribution of the quantized model approach that of the float model, which can be expressed formally as,  \n\n$$\na r g\\\\operatorname*{min}_{W_{l n}}L_{d i s t}(T(X),\\\\hat{T}(X))\n$$  \n\nwhere $T(X|W_{a t t n},W_{m l p},W_{l n})$ denotes a Transformer block, including the Attention module, MLP module, LayerNorm layer, and activation functions, and ${\\\\hat{T}}(X)$ represents its quantized version. $L_{d i s t}(\\\\cdot)$ denotes the distribution loss function between the quantized and float models. Our goal is then to design a strategy to optimize $\\\\hat{W}_{l n}$ to minimize $L_{d i s t}(\\\\cdot)$ , while keeping $\\\\hat{W}_{a t t n}$ and $\\\\hat{W}_{m l p}$ frozen.\n\n# Norm Tweaking\nMotivated by the above analysis, we propose a PTQ method for LLMs, called Norm-Tweaking, to quickly restore models\u2019 performance by slightly tweaking LayerNorm layers of the quantized model. Norm tweaking serves as a plugin to be easily embedded into other quantization methods. Here, we take GPTQ as an example and present a weight-only postquantization algorithm pipeline, as shown in Algorithm 1. Firstly , we use the LLM model to generate a set of text data as for calibration (explained in detail in the section on Calibration Dataset Generation), instead of directly sampling from real datasets. Next , we iteratively process each transformer layer, quantizing and updating the weights of the Linear layers, just like GPTQ. Finally , we compute a channelwise loss based on the difference between the distribution of quantized output and float output. We then use stochastic gradient descent to update the parameters of LayerNorm in this layer, forcing the activation distribution of the quantized model to mimic that of the float model. During this process, the rest parameters of the current layer such as Linear are frozen and do not participate in the weight update.  \n\nAlthough only the parameters of LayerNorm are updated, our process is distinct from parameter-efficient finetuning strategies. It should be noted that the parameters of the LayerNorm layer are very sensitive and excessive tuning can seriously damage the quantized models\u2019 performance (see Table 6). We slightly update the LayerNorm with a relaxed constraint, whose goal is to make the quantized models\u2019 distribution approaching that of float ones. This is the very reason why we definite our method as a tweaking ,instead of finetuning.  \n\nAt a glimpse, we carefully design the entire tweaking procedure to achieve our goal. For example, we use a very small number of iterations during tuning, typically only one iteration on the calibration text is required. We also adopt a small learning rate and design a step scheduler to assign different learning rates for the subsequent layers. In addition, our calibration data generation and the design of the distribution loss function harmoniously resonate with our tweaking principle.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Algorithm 1: Norm-Tweaking</td></tr><tr><td>Input: Pre-trained LLM model Output: Quantized LLM model 1:Generate calibration dataset (n-samples = 128,</td></tr><tr><td>token_length = 2048) using pre-trained LLM model 2: for each layer-l in the Transformer structure (L layers</td></tr><tr><td>total) do 3: if l = O then</td></tr><tr><td>4: use calibration data as input 5: else</td></tr><tr><td>6: use last output qOuti-1 as input 7: end if</td></tr><tr><td>8: Calculate the foat output fOuti 9: Quantize the weights of layer l 10: Freeze all Linear's weights in layer l 11: foreachitfortotalItersdo 12: Calculate the float output qOuti 13: Calculate Ldist between fOuti and qOut1 14: Backward and update LayerNorms\u2019 parameters 15: end for 16: end for 17: Get the high-performance quantized LLMs</td></tr></table></body></html>\u300d\n", "cf852a98-8ebb-40f0-bf13-6ea29fc63dd5:\u300cref_ids: 454846008172788376, chunk_ids: 4, Score: 0.4570, Text: # 5.3 LAYER NORM TUNING HAS SMALLER GRADIENT VARIANCE\nA well accepted view about LayerNorm is that, as the neural network goes deeper, the mean of LayerNorm gradients should goes to zero as the LayerNorm itself is designed to normalize all training parameters. In the meantime, the variance of LayerNorm gradients should be small to ensure a better generalization ability of the model ( Xu et al. ,2019 ) (See the proof in Appendix A.2.2 ). As we presented in fig. 4 , MLLM with LayerNorm tuning method has a more concentrated LayerNorm gradients than fine-tuning during the training process. This result gives another view on the effectiveness of LayerNorm from the optimization perspective. More visualizations are listed in Appendix A.2.2 .\n\n# 6 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSIONS\nLayerNorm is effective and sufficient built upon MLLM pre-training. MLLM training typically involves pre-training on image-text pairs followed by finetuning on visual instruction data. While the second stage of training receives more attention, it is worth noting that the function of the first stage pre-training is non-negligible for training a competent MLLM. We have presented in the paper only a small portion of parameter activation is sufficient to tune a well-behaved MLLM. However, other models such as I NSTRUCT BLIP ( Dai et al. ,2023 ) and M INI GPT4 ( Zhu et al. ,2023 ) only tune the vision-language connector, leaving the LLM untouched during the second stage of training. These models have yielded strong performances when given a large-scale finetuning dataset. In Sec. 5.1 , we demonstrate that tuning LayerNorm may be a more effective means for the second stage training, especially when compared to existing parameter-efficient methods for training MLLMs.  \n\nLimitations. One shortcoming of these parameter-efficient finetuning methods is that they are more sensitive to hyper-parameters ( e.g ., learning rate, training epoch) than finetuning. Since the number of trainable parameters of LayerNorm is small, the model performance of LayerNorm method also varies when twitching the training hyper-parameters. This drawback calls for potential future investigations on the LayerNorm tuning method. In the Appendix A.1 , we give a hint for the grid search range of learning rate on both 7B and 13B scaled models using LayerNorm tuning based on our experimental results.  \n\nConclusion. Our studies demonstrate LayerNorm tuning as a simple yet effective tuning method for adapting LLMs comprehend multi-modal content across various model variants. Compared to LoRA tuning or full parameter finetuning, LayerNorm tuning reduces the trainable parameters by a significant $41.9\\\\%$ , enabling efficient finetuning of MLLMs on consumer-grade GPUs. Moreover, we demonstrate that MLLMs can achieve exceptional performance with minimal \u201cright\u201d data and parameters, showcasing the potential of LayerNorm tuning method in real-world applications. Given the empirical success of LayerNorm tuning, we revisited the MLLM finetuning from a domain adaptation perspective and showed that LayerNorm plays a critical role in adapting LLMs to the multi-modal domain. Additionally, our research illustrates the expressive power and optimization potential of LayerNorm tuning from layer similarities and the gradient variance. We hope that our work could inspire future works on designing improved PEFT methods that enable more diverse application scenarios for MLLMs.\n\n\n\n# A A PPENDIX\n\n# A.1 TRAINING DETAILS\nFor the first stage, we set the learning rate to 2e-3 for all variants.

In section 5.2 , we have shown the computed cosine similarity between layers on a Vicuna model, here we show the layer similarities between layers on LL A MA2 and LL A MA2 CHAT models in fig. A1 and fig. A2 . It is clear that, LayerNorm tuning again allows the model to learn dissimilar layer representations, improving the expressive power of the model.\n\n# A.2.2 GRADIENTS OF LAYER NORM\nVisualization examples of LayerNorm gradients. In fig. A3 and fig. A4 , we present the gradients of the LayerNorm parameters during the training process. Similar to the one we have shown in the main text, LayerNorm tuning demonstrates a smaller gradient variance which is important for converging to a better local minimum ( Xu et al. ,2019 ).  \n\nProof of smaller variance in LayerNorm . As stated in Sec. 5.3 , deeper the network is, the variance of LayerNorm in the model should be naturally smaller ( $\\\\mathrm{\\\\DeltaXu}$ et al. ,2019 ). We first let $\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\,=\\\\,(y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{N})$ be the normalized vector, meaning the mean and variance of $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is 0 and 1 ,respectively. We can then formulate the standard LayerNorm as follow:  \n\n$$\n{\\\\mathbf{y}}={\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{x}-{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}}}{\\\\sigma}},\\\\quad{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}}={\\\\frac{1}{N}}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i},\\\\quad\\\\sigma={\\\\sqrt{{\\\\frac{1}{N}}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\\\left(x_{i}-{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}}\\\\right)^{2}}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{x}=(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{N})$ is the input vector and $N$ is the dimension of $\\\\mathbf{x}$ .$\\\\mu$ and $\\\\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of $\\\\mathbf{x}$ .  \n\nWe first define $\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}=\\\\underbrace{(1,1,...,1)^{\\\\intercal}}_{N}$ . For calculating the gradients of the normalized vector $\\\\mathbf{y}$ , we first simulate the backward propagation regarding the loss {z }$\\\\ell$ :  \n\n$$\n{\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ell}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{x}}}=\\\\left({\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{y}}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{x}}}+{\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mu}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{x}}}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{y}}{\\\\partial\\\\mu}}+{\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\sigma}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{x}}}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{y}}{\\\\partial\\\\sigma}}\\\\right){\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ell}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{y}}}={\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma}}\\\\left(I-{\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\mathbf{y}^{\\\\intercal}}{N}}-{\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}^{\\\\intercal}}{N}}\\\\right){\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ell}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{y}}}.\n$$  \n\n  \nFigure A1: Layer similarities between different LLM layers in (a) Finetuned and (b) LayerNormtuned MM-LL A MA2-7B.  \n\nHere we define $\\\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ell}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf x}}&{{}\\\\!\\\\!=}&{\\\\!\\\\!(a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N})}\\\\end{array}$ with mean $\\\\bar{a}$ and standard deviation $D_{a}$ , and $\\\\begin{array}{r l}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ell}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{y}}}&{{}=}\\\\end{array}$ $(b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{N})$ with mean $\\\\bar{b}$ and standard deviation $D_{b}$ . We set $\\\\begin{array}{r}{W_{1}\\\\;=\\\\;I\\\\,-\\\\,\\\\frac{{\\\\bf y}{\\\\bf y}^{\\\\intercal}}{N}\\\\,-\\\\,\\\\frac{{\\\\bf1}_{N}{\\\\bf1}_{N}^{\\\\intercal}}{N}}\\\\end{array}$ \u2212, we can verify that:  \n\n$$\n\\\\lfloor\\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}_{N}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}W_{1}=\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma}}\\\\left(I-{\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}+\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\mathbf{y}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}}{N}}\\\\right)={\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma}}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}-{\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}}{N}}\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}-{\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\mathbf{y}}{N}}\\\\mathbf{y}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\right)={\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}-\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}-0}{\\\\sigma}}=0\n$$  \n\nTherefore, we can easily proof that $N\\\\bar{a}\\\\propto{\\\\bf1}_{N}^{\\\\top}W_{1}\\\\bar{b}=0$ , which means the mean of $\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ell}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{x}}$ should be zero. Then we dive into proofing the variance of LayerNorm gradients should be small when the number of network parameters $N$ becomes large.  \n\n$$\n\\\\begin{array}{l}{{\\\\displaystyle{D_{a}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(a_{i}-\\\\bar{a})^{2}/N=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_{i}^{2}/N}\\\\ ~}}\\\\\\\\ {{\\\\displaystyle{=\\\\left\\\\|{(a_{1},a_{2},\\\\ldots,a_{N})^{\\\\top}}\\\\right\\\\|^{2}/N}\\\\ ~}}\\\\\\\\ {{\\\\displaystyle{=\\\\left\\\\|{W_{1}\\\\left(b_{1},b_{2},\\\\ldots,b_{N}\\\\right)^{\\\\top}}\\\\right\\\\|^{2}/N}\\\\ ~}}\\\\\\\\ {{\\\\displaystyle{=\\\\left\\\\|{W_{1}\\\\left(b_{1}-\\\\bar{b},b_{2}-\\\\bar{b},\\\\ldots,b_{N}-\\\\bar{b}\\\\right)^{\\\\top}+W_{1}\\\\bar{b}{\\\\bf1}_{N}}\\\\right\\\\|^{2}/N}\\\\ }}\\\\\\\\ {{\\\\displaystyle{=\\\\left\\\\|{W_{1}\\\\left(g_{1}-\\\\bar{b},g_{2}-\\\\bar{b},\\\\ldots,g_{N}-\\\\bar{b}\\\\right)^{\\\\top}}\\\\right\\\\|^{2}/N}\\\\ ~}}\\\\\\\\ {{\\\\displaystyle{\\\\leq W_{1}^{2}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(b_{i}-\\\\bar{b})^{2}/N}\\\\ }}\\\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSince the projection matrix $W_{1}$ is idempotent, we have $W_{1}^{2}=W_{1}$ . That is to say, when $N$ is large enough, there stands the network parameter $\\\\begin{array}{r}{D_{a}\\\\le\\\\big(I-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\mathbf{y}^{\\\\top}+\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}\\\\mathbf{1}_{N}^{\\\\top}}{N}\\\\big)\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(b_{i}-\\\\bar{b_{}})^{2}/N\\\\propto1/N^{2}}\\\\end{array}$ Nis large, the gradient variance of LayerNorm should be small.

In our previous experiments, we focused on finetuning the LLM component of the MLLMs while keeping the vision-language connector activated by default. To determine which component plays a more important role for domain adaptation of LLM to multi-modal domain, we performed an ablation study by activating the two components separately. Results are presented in table 4 , tuning LayerNorm in attention blocks without activating the vision-language connector resulted in only a $4.2\\\\%$ and $5.4\\\\%$ decrease in performance on three traditional multi-modal tasks and the MME benchmark, respectively. This decrease is significantly lower than the $15.6\\\\%$ and $9.2\\\\%$ downgrade observed when only activating the Connector on the same tasks. This observation highlights the vital role LayerNorm plays in transforming knowledge from the vision domain to language, indicating LayerNorm as a strong domain adaptor for the LLM architecture.  \n\n  \n\nFigure 3: Layer similarities between different LLM layers in (a) Finetuned and (b) LayerNorm-tuned MM-V ICUNA -7B.

We employ the ViT encoder from CLIP ( Radford et al. ,2021 ) by default in our previous experiments. CLIP ( Radford et al. ,2021 ) models are trained with image-text contrastive loss, thus its feature space is already aligned with language. Since LayerNorm has shown its effectiveness as a domain adaptor, we are interested in testing whether or not LayerNorm tuning can adapt a LLM to image features that are not pretrained to align with language. The vision encoder is switched to a ViT model that was pretrained on ImageNet (Dosovitskiy et al. ,2021 ;Deng et al. ,2009 ). Results in table 5 demonstrate that both LayerNorm and finetuning approaches can yield high performance. Interestingly, we observe that by LayerNorm tuning with ImageNet trained ViT, which has not been aligned with language, the model is able to achieve comparable performance to full parameter finetuning , i.e ., results show that LayerNorm tuning outperforms finetuning by $12.0\\\\%$ on captioning tasks, but performs slightly worse by $5.0\\\\%$ on the MME benchmark. These results again indicates the domain adaptor role of the LayerNorm , hinting the reason behind the empircal success of LayerNorm tuning. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the performance of MLLMs incorporating ViT pretrained on ImageNet is generally inferior to that of CLIP\u2019s vision encoder. This observation provides compelling evidence that, despite differences in tokenizer and training paradigm between CLIP\u2019s text encoder and LL A MA\u2019s, ViT from CLIP has the capacity to learn general patterns of language formulation during pre-training. Thus, significantly enhance MLLM abilities.\n\n# 5.2 LAYER NORM TUNING I MPROVES THE EXPRESSIVE POWER\nIt is shown in Pires et al. (2023 ) that a Transformer model incorporating anisotropic layer representation can capture a wider range of learning patterns. By computing the cosine similarities between all layers in the LLM of a finetuned MLLM, we aim to investigate whether the improved efficiency is the results of the improved expressive power. In table 6 , we present the average layer similarity of three 7B scale MLLMs, and in fig. 3 we present the visualization of per layer similarity scores of MM-V ICUNA -7B. Our analysis reveals that the transformer layers in the MLLMs with LayerNorm tuning exhibit a clear distinction from one another ( i.e ., an average $10.6\\\\%$ lower layer similarities comparing finetuning), indicating superior generalization ability and expressive power compared to finetuning. This finding sheds light on why tuning LayerNorm is effective for multi-modal LLM training. For additional visualizations, please refer to the Appendix A.2.1 .  \n\n  \nFigure 4: Gradients of the input LayerNorm in the 11th layer of the MM-V ICUNA as training proceeds.
