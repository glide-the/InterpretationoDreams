In our previous experiments, we focused on finetuning the LLM component of the MLLMs while keeping the vision-language connector activated by default. To determine which component plays a more important role for domain adaptation of LLM to multi-modal domain, we performed an ablation study by activating the two components separately. Results are presented in table 4 , tuning LayerNorm in attention blocks without activating the vision-language connector resulted in only a $4.2\\\\%$ and $5.4\\\\%$ decrease in performance on three traditional multi-modal tasks and the MME benchmark, respectively. This decrease is significantly lower than the $15.6\\\\%$ and $9.2\\\\%$ downgrade observed when only activating the Connector on the same tasks. This observation highlights the vital role LayerNorm plays in transforming knowledge from the vision domain to language, indicating LayerNorm as a strong domain adaptor for the LLM architecture.  \n\n  \n\nFigure 3: Layer similarities between different LLM layers in (a) Finetuned and (b) LayerNorm-tuned MM-V ICUNA -7B.

We employ the ViT encoder from CLIP ( Radford et al. ,2021 ) by default in our previous experiments. CLIP ( Radford et al. ,2021 ) models are trained with image-text contrastive loss, thus its feature space is already aligned with language. Since LayerNorm has shown its effectiveness as a domain adaptor, we are interested in testing whether or not LayerNorm tuning can adapt a LLM to image features that are not pretrained to align with language. The vision encoder is switched to a ViT model that was pretrained on ImageNet (Dosovitskiy et al. ,2021 ;Deng et al. ,2009 ). Results in table 5 demonstrate that both LayerNorm and finetuning approaches can yield high performance. Interestingly, we observe that by LayerNorm tuning with ImageNet trained ViT, which has not been aligned with language, the model is able to achieve comparable performance to full parameter finetuning , i.e ., results show that LayerNorm tuning outperforms finetuning by $12.0\\\\%$ on captioning tasks, but performs slightly worse by $5.0\\\\%$ on the MME benchmark. These results again indicates the domain adaptor role of the LayerNorm , hinting the reason behind the empircal success of LayerNorm tuning. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the performance of MLLMs incorporating ViT pretrained on ImageNet is generally inferior to that of CLIP\u2019s vision encoder. This observation provides compelling evidence that, despite differences in tokenizer and training paradigm between CLIP\u2019s text encoder and LL A MA\u2019s, ViT from CLIP has the capacity to learn general patterns of language formulation during pre-training. Thus, significantly enhance MLLM abilities.\n\n# 5.2 LAYER NORM TUNING I MPROVES THE EXPRESSIVE POWER\nIt is shown in Pires et al. (2023 ) that a Transformer model incorporating anisotropic layer representation can capture a wider range of learning patterns. By computing the cosine similarities between all layers in the LLM of a finetuned MLLM, we aim to investigate whether the improved efficiency is the results of the improved expressive power. In table 6 , we present the average layer similarity of three 7B scale MLLMs, and in fig. 3 we present the visualization of per layer similarity scores of MM-V ICUNA -7B. Our analysis reveals that the transformer layers in the MLLMs with LayerNorm tuning exhibit a clear distinction from one another ( i.e ., an average $10.6\\\\%$ lower layer similarities comparing finetuning), indicating superior generalization ability and expressive power compared to finetuning. This finding sheds light on why tuning LayerNorm is effective for multi-modal LLM training. For additional visualizations, please refer to the Appendix A.2.1 .  \n\n  \nFigure 4: Gradients of the input LayerNorm in the 11th layer of the MM-V ICUNA as training proceeds.

We then analyze the off-target rates and structural discrepancies between PreNorm and PostNorm to understand performance differences.  \n\n$$\n\\\\mathrm{LayerNorm}(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{x})}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\mathbf{V}(\\\\mathbf{x})}}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{g}+\\\\mathbf{b},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{g}$ and $\\\\mathbf{b}$ are trainable gain and bias. $\\\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\\\mathbf{V}$ indicate expectation and variance. LayerNorm is commonly used in two positions in the Transformer, as shown in Fig. 1 . PostNorm, which is the originally proposed setting of the Transformer ( Vaswani et al. ,2017 ), involves applying LayerNorm after each sub-module (i.e., selfattention or feed-forward network) and residual connections. PreNorm ( Baevski and Auli ,2019 ), on the other hand, involves applying LayerNorm directly before each sub-module and is known to stabilize Transformer training. While variants of Transformer LayerNorm like RMSNorm ( Zhang and Sennrich ,2019 ) have been proposed, the vanilla PreNorm and PostNorm are still the most widely adopted settings in current multilingual\n\n# 3.1 Experimental Settings\nDatasets We perform ZST experiments on three datasets: OPUS ( Zhang et al. ,2020 ), IWSLT ( Cettolo et al. ,2017 ), and Europarl ( Koehn ,2005 ). The statistics of the datasets are summarized in Table 1 .We include 7 ,4 , and 5 languages for each dataset. The training data consists of only English-centric sentence pairs, resulting in 30 ,6 , and 12 ZST directions for each dataset. The total number of parallel sentences for each dataset is 12 .00 M, 1 .38 M, and 15 .78 M, respectively. We apply BPE ( Sennrich et al. ,2016 ) with merge operations of 50 k, 40 k, and $50\\\\mathbf{k}$ to create a joint vocabulary for each dataset.  \n\nTraining We employ Transformer-base model for OPUS and IWSLT, and Transformer-big for Europarl, in accordance with the distinct sizes of training data. We consider the following settings: (1) PreNorm or PostNorm : PreNorm involves LayerNorm directly before each sub-module (i.e., self-attention or feed-forward network), while PostNorm applies LayerNorm after each sub-module and residual connections, as shown in Fig. 1 .(2) S-ENC-T-DEC or T-ENC : Source language tag on the encoder-side and target language tag on the decoder-side; or only target language tag on the encoder-side. Wu et al. (2021 ) showed that this setting impacts ZST for Transformer with PreNorm. (3) w/ or w/o Res. : With the residual connection for self-attention in the middle $(4^{t h})$ encoder layer or not. Liu et al. (2021 ) revealed that \u201cw/o Res.\u201d improves ZST for the model trained with PreNorm. We experiment this with different LayerNorm settings as this may reduce the potential of overfitting on supervised directions, then further impacts ZST, which aligns with our hypothesis.  \n\nTable 2: BLEU scores and off-target rates (shown in brackets) . We report the average score of three seeds; refer to Appendix Gfor BLEU score of each translation direction and seed. \u201cRes.\u201d indicates the residual connection of self-attention in the $4^{t h}$ encoder layer. We mark lower off-target rates and significantly higher BLEU scores ( Koehn ,2004 ) between PreNorm and PostNorm in bold for ZST.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>#</td><td>Layer Norm</td><td>Language Tag</td><td>Res.</td><td></td><td>Zero-shot</td><td></td><td></td><td>Supervised</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td></td><td>Pivot</td><td></td><td>OPUS 21.8</td><td>IWSLT 20.0</td><td>Europarl 29.5</td><td>OPUS</td><td>IWSLT</td><td>Europarl</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>PreNorm</td><td>S-ENC-T-DEC</td><td>w/</td><td>10.1 (42.19%)</td><td>4.9 (64.84%)</td><td>24.9 ( 7.73%)</td><td>33.7</td><td>31.5</td><td>34.3</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>PostNorm</td><td>S-ENC-T-DEC</td><td>w/</td><td>16.8 ( 8.59%)</td><td>12.4 (10.61%)</td><td>29.2( 0.34%)</td><td>33.9</td><td>31.5</td><td>34.5</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>PreNorm</td><td>T-ENC</td><td>w/</td><td>13.3 (22.99%)</td><td>13.7 ( 3.98%)</td><td>29.5( 0.23%)</td><td>33.7</td><td>31.6</td><td>34.4</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>PostNorm</td><td>T-ENC</td><td>w/</td><td>14.0 (22.86%)</td><td>15.5 ( 4.59%)</td><td>30.8 ( 0.11%)</td><td>34.1</td><td>31.5</td><td>34.5</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>PreNorm</td><td>S-ENC-T-DEC</td><td>w/o</td><td>14.3 (20.67%)</td><td>8.0 (50.16%)</td><td>16.7 (41.87%)</td><td>33.6</td><td>30.9</td><td>34.3</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>PostNorm</td><td>S-ENC-T-DEC</td><td>w/o</td><td>16.0 (15.27%)</td><td>17.4 (1.83%)</td><td>29.0 ( 0.41%)</td><td>33.8</td><td>30.7</td><td>34.4</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>PreNorm</td><td>T-ENC</td><td>w/o</td><td>13.4 (27.15%)</td><td>16.2 ( 1.54%)</td><td>29.9 ( 2.15%)</td><td>33.5</td><td>30.9</td><td>34.3</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>PostNorm</td><td>T-ENC</td><td>w/o</td><td>13.9 (26.68%)</td><td>17.8 (1.50%)</td><td>30.8 ( 0.13%)</td><td>33.9</td><td>30.6</td><td>34.4</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe settings above lead to eight different combinations, shown in Table 2 (#1 - #8). Additional training details are in Appendix A .\n\n# 3.2 Main Results\nWe evaluate ZST systems using SacreBLEU ( Post ,2018 ) and off-target rates. We report in Table 2 BLEU scores for both zero-shot and supervised directions. For ZST, we also present pivot-based translation results as a reference. Implementation details of evaluation can be found in Appendix B.Our findings are as follows:  \n\nPreNorm vs. PostNorm :We find that PostNorm consistently yields better BLEU scores than PreNorm for ZST across various language tag and residual connection settings, while their performance is comparable for supervised directions.  \n\nImpact of Language Tag and Residual Connection: We observe that using the \u201cT-ENC\u201d language tag and \u201cw/ Res.\u201d improves ZST performance for IWSLT, which aligns with the findings of $\\\\mathrm{Wu}$ et al. (2021 ) and Liu et al. (2021 ). Nevertheless, the best performance is achieved using \u201cw/ Res.\u201d for PostNorm with \u201cS-ENC-T-DEC\u201d and \u201cT-ENC\u201d tags for OPUS and Europarl, respectively (#2 and #4). Given that Wu et al. (2021 ) and Liu et al. (2021 )used PreNorm as the default setting (#2, #4, #6 and #8 are unreported results in their work), our results emphasize the need to consider PostNorm as the default setting for ZST, while the language tag and residual connection settings have less impact.  \n\nOff-target Rates : Off-target rates help understand the different BLEU score gaps between PreNorm and PostNorm, which ranges from 0 .5 to 12 .3 BLEU points. For PreNorm and PostNorm with the \u201cT-ENC\u201d language tag (#3, #4, #7, and #8), they have similar off-target rates, with a discrepancy ranging from $-0.61\\\\%$ to $2.02\\\\%$ , which results in narrow BLEU score gaps, ranging from 0 .5 to 1 .8 points. However, for PreNorm and PostNorm with the \u201cS-ENC-T-DEC\u201d language tag (#1, #2, #5, and #6), the off-target rates show a more considerable discrepancy, ranging from $5.40\\\\%$ to $54.23\\\\%$ , resulting in BLEU score gaps from 1 .7 to 12 .3 points. Further analysis of the nature of Transformer hidden states in the next section explores the reason for these different off-target rates in translations.\u300d\n", "3a7d70c7-f009-48af-ae58-c4dce5e11011:\u300cref_ids: 454846009781566216, chunk_ids: 0, Score: 0.1904, Text: # I EMPIRICAL RESULTS REGARDING THEOREM 1\nNote that Theorem 1 assumes that feature vectors $n$ are normally-distributed, which may not necessarily occur in practice (although given that observables and observable-derived feature vectors are only introduced in this work, it is hard to say whether this is false more generally; more research is necessary, including research on the sorts of observables that practitioners wish to analyze in practice). However, the intention of Theorem 1 is to provide motivation that underpins what we found empirically: namely, that feature vectors computer by taking LayerNorm into account have extremely high cosine similarities with feature vectors computed without taking LayerNorm into account.  \n\nTable 6: Cosine similarities between the feature vectors used in Section 4.3, computed with and without LayerNorms   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Task</td><td>Cosines similarity</td><td>Angle (radians)</td></tr><tr><td>Subject pronoun prediction (attention 6::6)</td><td>0.99779</td><td>0.0664</td></tr><tr><td>C VS.H Python</td><td>0.99936</td><td>0.0358</td></tr><tr><td>Political party p prediction</td><td>0.99900</td><td>0.0447</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nIn particular, for the feature vectors considered in Section 4.3, these cosine similarities and angles are given in Table 6. For reference, note that the upper bound on the angle between these feature vectors according to Theorem 1 is approximately 0.0442 radians. The feature vectors for subject pronoun prediction have a higher angle between them of 0.0664 radians, but this can be attributed to the fact that the circuit for these feature vectors goes through multiple LayerNorms. Additionally, the angle for the political party prediction feature vector is also slightly higher than the bound predicted by the theorem; but it is worth noting that the theorem predicts a bound on the expected angle, rather than a bound on the maximum angle; this also might be due to the scaling matrix $W$ in the LayerNorm (see Appendix E).\u300d\n"]}}, "__type__": "1"}}, "template_store/metadata": {"4703f400-d39c-4990-8b03-5182ce0553a7": {"template_hash": ""}}}
