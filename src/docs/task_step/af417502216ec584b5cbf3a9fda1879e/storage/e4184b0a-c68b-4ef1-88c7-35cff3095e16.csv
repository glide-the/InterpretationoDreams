In this section, we give the formal definition of LayerNorm $\\operatorname{LN}(\\cdot)$ and RMS Norm ${\\mathrm{RMS}}\\left(\\cdot\\right)$ .  

Definition 1 (LayerNorm) .LayerNorm $L N(\\cdot;\\mu,\\beta,\\epsilon)$ of dimension $D$ is defined as:  

$$
L N(\\mathbf{x};\\pmb{\\mu},\\beta,\\epsilon)=\\frac{\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{x}]}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[\\mathbf{x}]+\\epsilon}}\\odot\\pmb{\\mu}+\\beta,
$$  

where $\\mathbf{x},\\pmb{\\mu},\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D}$ .  

Definition 2 (RMSNorm) .RMS Norm $R M S(\\cdot;\\mu,\\epsilon)$ of dimension $D$ is defined as:  

$$
R M S(\\mathbf{x};\\pmb{\\mu},\\epsilon)=\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{D}\\sum_{i=1}^{D}(\\mathbf{x}[i])^{2}+\\epsilon}}\\odot\\pmb{\\mu},
$$  

where x,$\\pmb{\\mu}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D}$ .  

Remark. In neural networks, inputs of normalization layers are usually high dimension tensors. In this case, LayerNorm and RMSNorm normally apply to the last dimension separately.

In this section, we first give the general definition of lossless expansion in vector space.

Remark. Note that the identity function Id is lossless with its inverse being itself.  

Then we give a few examples of lossless vector space expansions. These examples will also be used in LEMON.  

Example B.3.1 (Vector average expansion $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{avg.}}$ ).Let $\\mathbf{\\widetilde{x}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D_{S}}$ be a vector of dimension $D_{S}$ and its average $\\begin{array}{r}{\\lambda_{V}g(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{x}]=\\frac{1}{D_{S}}\\sum_{i}^{D_{S}}\\mathbf{x}[i]}\\end{array}$ P].$\\mathbf{x}_{a\\nu g}^{*}$ is called the average expanded xof dimension $D_{T}$  

with $D_{T}\\geq D_{S}$ if  

$$

$$  

Example B.3.2 (Vector z o expansion $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{zero.}}$ ).Le $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D_{S}}$ be a vector of dimension $D_{S}$ .$\\mathbf{x}_{z e r o}^{*}$ is called the zero expanded xof dimension $D_{T}$ with $D_{T}\\geq D_{S}$ ≥if

$$  

Example B.3.3 (Vector circula expansion $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{circ}})$ Let $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D_{S}}$ a vector of dimension $D_{S}$ .${\\bf x}_{c i r c}^{*}$ is called the circular expanded xof dimension $D_{T}$ with $D_{T}\\geq D_{S}$ ≥if

$$  

Example B.3.4 (Vector random expansion $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{rand.}}$ Let $\\mathbf{\\Deltax}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D_{S}}$ a vector of dimension $D_{S}$ .${\\bf x}_{r a n d}^{*}$ is called the random expanded xof dimension $D_{T}$ with $D_{T}\\geq D_{S}$ ≥if

$$  

where $\\zeta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D_{T}}$ mod $D_{S}$ is an arbitrary vector.  

Remark. (1) All vector expansion examples above follow the same pattern. Specifically, when $D_{T}$ expanding from di mod s by $D_{S}$ entries differently. (2) The random vector ating $\\textbf{x}\\lfloor D_{T}/D_{S}\\rfloor D_{S}$ ⌊$D_{S}$ ⌋$D_{T}$ number of times. , all vector expansion methods pad first $\\zeta$ in vector random expansion is arbitrary, Each method deals with the remaining $\\lfloor D_{T}/D_{S}\\rfloor D_{S}$ enso $\\mathcal{V}_{a\\nu g}$ ,$\\mathcal{V}_{z e r o}$ ,$\\mathcal{V}_{c i r c}\\subset\\mathcal{V}_{r a n d}$ . (3) Here all three examples are expansion methods for vectors. In practice, neural networks like Transformers are dealing high dimensional tensors. These tensors can essentially be thought of as collections of vectors. In such scenarios, we can apply the expansion methods separately to the last dimension of these tensors.  

In the following claim, we show that vectors expanded by these operators are lossless.  

$\\mathcal{V}_{c i r c}$ V, and vector random expansion m 1. Vector average expansio V$\\gamma_{r a n d}$ $\\mathcal{V}_{a\\nu g},$ are all lossless expansion for vectors. , vector zero expansion $\\mathcal{V}_{z e r o}$ , vector circular expansion Proof. The inverse function $\\mathcal{V}^{-1}:\\mathbb{R}^{D_{T}}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{D_{S}}$ of these vector expansion methods is  

$$
\\nu^{-1}({\\bf x})={\\bf x}[:D_{S}].
$$  

Remark. In practice, we want inverse mapping of expansion methods to be easily computed just like the example above.

# B.4LOSSLESS EXPANSION FOR OPERATORS
We then give the definition of lossless expansion for operators. These operators apply on tensors, hence our definition of lossless operator expansion is based on lossless expansion in vector space. These operators can be different layers used in Transformer architectures, including LayerNorm, convolutional layers, and fully-connected layers, etc.

Now that every LayerNorm in the transformer has been converted to RMSNorm, we can select any $\\mathbf{Q}$ to modify the model. Our initial plan was to collect signals from the model, construct an orthogonal matrix using those signals and to delete parts of the network. We quickly saw that the signals at different blocks of the network were not aligned, and that we would need to apply a different orthogonal matrix at each block, $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ .  

Allowing the orthogonal matrix used in each block to differ can be shown to leave the model unchanged using the same proof as Theorem 1 ,  

  
Figure 3: Converting a transformer network from LayerNorm to RMSNorm: the scale matrix diag $(\\alpha)$ is absorbed into the subsequent matrix $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ . Figure shows the block in combined colors. We use $(\\alpha)$ for brevity. The mean-subtraction matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is applied to each matrix $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{out}}$ . Layernorm becomes RMSNorm, up to a constant $\\bar{\\sqrt{D}}$ (not shown). Here, the scaling $(\\alpha^{\\prime})$ comes from the previous block.  

  
Figure 4: With the network converted to RMSNorm (see Figure 3 ), we apply the computational-invariance idea. The input weight matrices $\\mathrm{diag}(\\alpha)\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ are pre-multiplied by $\\mathbf{Q}^{\\top}$ . The output matrices $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{out}}\\mathbf{M}$ are post-multiplied by $\\mathbf{Q}$ . In the skip-connection, a new linear layer is added $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell+1}$ . After these modifications, the matrices can be sliced (hatched areas).  

with the exception of line 5 of Algorithm 1 . Here we see that the residual connection and the output of the block must have the same rotation. To fix this, we modify the residual connection by applying the linear transformation applied to different blocks with the additional linear operation in the residual connection. Unlike the $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell-1}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ −to the residual. Figure 4 shows how different rotations can be modifications to the weight matrices, these additional operations cannot be pre-computed and add a small $(D\\times D)$ overhead to the model. Nonetheless, they are needed to allow slicing the model (Section 3.4 ) and we see real speedup overall (Section 4 ).  

To compute the matrices $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ , we use PCA. We select a calibration dataset from the training set, run it through the model (after converting LayerNorm operations into RMSNorm), and extract the orthogonal matrix of the layer. We use the output of the transformed network to calculate the orthogonal matrices of the next layers. More precisely, if $\\mathbf{X}_{\\ell,i}$ is the output of the $\\ell^{\\mathrm{th}}$ RMSNorm block for the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ sequence in the calibration dataset, we compute  

$$
\\mathbf{C}_{\\ell}=\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{X}_{\\ell,i}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}_{\\ell,i}
$$  

and set $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ to the be the eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{C}_{\\ell}$ , sorted by decreasing eigenvalues.

# 3.4 SLICING
The goal of Principal Component Analysis is usually to take a data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and compute a lower dimensional representation $\\mathbf{Z}$ , and an approximate reconstruction $\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}$ :  

$$
\\mathbf{Z}=\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{D}\\,,\\qquad\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}=\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{D}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}^{\\top}\\,.
$$  

where $\\mathbf{Q}$ is the ectors of ${\\bf X}^{\\top}{\\bf X}$ , and $\\mathbf{D}$ is a $D\\times D_{\\mathrm{small}}$ deletion matrix (containing $D_{\\mathrm{small}}$ The reconstruction is columns of the $D\\times D$ ×$L_{2}$ identity matrix), which removes some of the columns of the matrix to the left. optimal, in the sense that QD is a linear mapping that minimizes $\\lVert\\mathbf{X}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\rVert^{2}$ .  

When we apply PCA to the signal matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ bween blocks, we never materialize the $N\\times D$ signal matrix, but we apply the deletion matrix Dto the operations preceding and succeeding the construction of that matrix, which have already been multiplied by $\\mathbf{Q}$ in the above. We delete rows of $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ that we have inserted into the residual connection (see Figure and columns of $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{embd}}$ . We also delete both rows 4 ). and columns of the matrix $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell-1}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ −

# 4 EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
Setup We use HuggingFace Transformers ( Wolf et al. ,2019 ) to implement our code with PyTorch (Paszke et al. ,2019 ). The computation of $\\mathbf{Q}$ is performed on a single H100 GPU with 80GB of memory, taking approximately 3.5 hours to complete for the L LAMA -2 70B model. During the PCA calculation, we use double precision for computing the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. We find that using single precision for eigenvector calculations in PyTorch leads to a discrepancy in the final accuracy, as detailed in Appendix A.2 .  

We experiment with two different calibration sets: 1024 samples from the WikiText-2 training dataset ( Merity et al. ,2016 ) and 5000 samples from the Alpaca training dataset ( Taori et al. ,2023 ). Sequence lengths are chosen as the maximum of each language model. An ablation study on the calibration set size and sequence length is presented in Appendix A.3 .  

Models, Tasks, and GPUs We evaluate all our experiments on OPT ( Zhang et al. ,2022 ), L LAMA -2 (Touvron et al. ,2023 ) model families, and additionally evaluate Phi-2 (in our zero-shot task) experiments. We exclude OPT 175B, as it is outperformed by smaller L LAMA -2 models. Nonetheless, we anticipate that this larger model will yield improved results, as larger models typically offer more promising opportunities for compression (see Section 4.1 ). We evaluate our scheme on both language generation as well as popular zero-shot tasks. To demonstrate the comprehensive speedup achieved by SliceGPT we use: Quadro RTX6000 GPUs with 24GB of memory as a representative example of consumer-level GPUs; 40GB A100s and 80GB H100s to provide datacenter-level benchmarks.  

Baseline Setup We initially planned to compare our results against a scheme that pruned columns (or rows) with the smallest norm but found that this baseline was very poor, with the perplexity of the model soaring into the 1000s after pruning just a few columns. Instead, we compare SliceGPT against SparseGPT ( Frantar & Alistarh ,2023 ) employing a 2:4 sparsity ratio, as this is the only sparsity scheme which achieves speedup ( Mishra et al. ,2021 ).",8

# 5.1 LAYER NORM TUNING A DAPTS LLM S TO MULTI -M ODAL
Influence of the Vision-Language Connector The vision-language connector serves as the converter to project features from the vision encoder to the LLM domain. In our previous experiments, we focused on finetuning the LLM component of the MLLMs while keeping the vision-language connector activated by default. To determine which component plays a more important role for domain adaptation of LLM to multi-modal domain, we performed an ablation study by activating the two components separately. Results are presented in table 4 , tuning LayerNorm in attention blocks without activating the vision-language connector resulted in only a $4.2\\%$ and $5.4\\%$ decrease in performance on three traditional multi-modal tasks and the MME benchmark, respectively. This decrease is significantly lower than the $15.6\\%$ and $9.2\\%$ downgrade observed when only activating the Connector on the same tasks. This observation highlights the vital role LayerNorm plays in transforming knowledge from the vision domain to language, indicating LayerNorm as a strong domain adaptor for the LLM architecture.

Switching Visual Features. We employ the ViT encoder from CLIP ( Radford et al. ,2021 ) by default in our previous experiments. CLIP ( Radford et al. ,2021 ) models are trained with image-text contrastive loss, thus its feature space is already aligned with language. Since LayerNorm has shown its effectiveness as a domain adaptor, we are interested in testing whether or not LayerNorm tuning can adapt a LLM to image features that are not pretrained to align with language. The vision encoder is switched to a ViT model that was pretrained on ImageNet (Dosovitskiy et al. ,2021 ;Deng et al. ,2009 ). Results in table 5 demonstrate that both LayerNorm and finetuning approaches can yield high performance. Interestingly, we observe that by LayerNorm tuning with ImageNet trained ViT, which has not been aligned with language, the model is able to achieve comparable performance to full parameter finetuning , i.e ., results show that LayerNorm tuning outperforms finetuning by $12.0\\%$ on captioning tasks, but performs slightly worse by $5.0\\%$ on the MME benchmark. These results again indicates the domain adaptor role of the LayerNorm , hinting the reason behind the empircal success of LayerNorm tuning. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the performance of MLLMs incorporating ViT pretrained on ImageNet is generally inferior to that of CLIP’s vision encoder. This observation provides compelling evidence that, despite differences in tokenizer and training paradigm between CLIP’s text encoder and LL A MA’s, ViT from CLIP has the capacity to learn general patterns of language formulation during pre-training. Thus, significantly enhance MLLM abilities.

# 5.2 LAYER NORM TUNING I MPROVES THE EXPRESSIVE POWER
It is shown in Pires et al. (2023 ) that a Transformer model incorporating anisotropic layer representation can capture a wider range of learning patterns. By computing the cosine similarities between all layers in the LLM of a finetuned MLLM, we aim to investigate whether the improved efficiency is the results of the improved expressive power. In table 6 , we present the average layer similarity of three 7B scale MLLMs, and in fig. 3 we present the visualization of per layer similarity scores of MM-V ICUNA -7B. Our analysis reveals that the transformer layers in the MLLMs with LayerNorm tuning exhibit a clear distinction from one another ( i.e ., an average $10.6\\%$ lower layer similarities comparing finetuning), indicating superior generalization ability and expressive power compared to finetuning. This finding sheds light on why tuning LayerNorm is effective for multi-modal LLM training. For additional visualizations, please refer to the Appendix A.2.1 .
