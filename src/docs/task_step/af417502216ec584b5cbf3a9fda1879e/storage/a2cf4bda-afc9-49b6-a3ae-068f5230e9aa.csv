在自然语言处理（NLP）任务中，Transformer模型广泛使用了LayerNorm作为归一化方法。然而，RMSNorm作为一种更简单的归一化方法，在某些情况下表现出相似甚至更优的性能。那么，在具体的NLP任务（如文本分类或问答系统）中，RMSNorm是否能够替代LayerNorm？如果可以，它在哪些方面表现更优？如果不能，LayerNorm在哪些关键点上仍然不可替代？",1>1

Now that every LayerNorm in the transformer has been converted to RMSNorm, we can select any $\\mathbf{Q}$ to modify the model. Our initial plan was to collect signals from the model, construct an orthogonal matrix using those signals and to delete parts of the network. We quickly saw that the signals at different blocks of the network were not aligned, and that we would need to apply a different orthogonal matrix at each block, $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ .  

Allowing the orthogonal matrix used in each block to differ can be shown to leave the model unchanged using the same proof as Theorem 1 ,  

  
Figure 3: Converting a transformer network from LayerNorm to RMSNorm: the scale matrix diag $(\\alpha)$ is absorbed into the subsequent matrix $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ . Figure shows the block in combined colors. We use $(\\alpha)$ for brevity. The mean-subtraction matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is applied to each matrix $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{out}}$ . Layernorm becomes RMSNorm, up to a constant $\\bar{\\sqrt{D}}$ (not shown). Here, the scaling $(\\alpha^{\\prime})$ comes from the previous block.  

  
Figure 4: With the network converted to RMSNorm (see Figure 3 ), we apply the computational-invariance idea. The input weight matrices $\\mathrm{diag}(\\alpha)\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ are pre-multiplied by $\\mathbf{Q}^{\\top}$ . The output matrices $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{out}}\\mathbf{M}$ are post-multiplied by $\\mathbf{Q}$ . In the skip-connection, a new linear layer is added $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell+1}$ . After these modifications, the matrices can be sliced (hatched areas).  

with the exception of line 5 of Algorithm 1 . Here we see that the residual connection and the output of the block must have the same rotation. To fix this, we modify the residual connection by applying the linear transformation applied to different blocks with the additional linear operation in the residual connection. Unlike the $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell-1}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ −to the residual. Figure 4 shows how different rotations can be modifications to the weight matrices, these additional operations cannot be pre-computed and add a small $(D\\times D)$ overhead to the model. Nonetheless, they are needed to allow slicing the model (Section 3.4 ) and we see real speedup overall (Section 4 ).  

To compute the matrices $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ , we use PCA. We select a calibration dataset from the training set, run it through the model (after converting LayerNorm operations into RMSNorm), and extract the orthogonal matrix of the layer. We use the output of the transformed network to calculate the orthogonal matrices of the next layers. More precisely, if $\\mathbf{X}_{\\ell,i}$ is the output of the $\\ell^{\\mathrm{th}}$ RMSNorm block for the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ sequence in the calibration dataset, we compute  

$$
\\mathbf{C}_{\\ell}=\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{X}_{\\ell,i}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}_{\\ell,i}
$$  

and set $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ to the be the eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{C}_{\\ell}$ , sorted by decreasing eigenvalues.

# 3.4 SLICING
The goal of Principal Component Analysis is usually to take a data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and compute a lower dimensional representation $\\mathbf{Z}$ , and an approximate reconstruction $\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}$ :  

$$
\\mathbf{Z}=\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{D}\\,,\\qquad\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}=\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{D}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}^{\\top}\\,.
$$  

where $\\mathbf{Q}$ is the ectors of ${\\bf X}^{\\top}{\\bf X}$ , and $\\mathbf{D}$ is a $D\\times D_{\\mathrm{small}}$ deletion matrix (containing $D_{\\mathrm{small}}$ The reconstruction is columns of the $D\\times D$ ×$L_{2}$ identity matrix), which removes some of the columns of the matrix to the left. optimal, in the sense that QD is a linear mapping that minimizes $\\lVert\\mathbf{X}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\rVert^{2}$ .  

When we apply PCA to the signal matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ bween blocks, we never materialize the $N\\times D$ signal matrix, but we apply the deletion matrix Dto the operations preceding and succeeding the construction of that matrix, which have already been multiplied by $\\mathbf{Q}$ in the above. We delete rows of $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ that we have inserted into the residual connection (see Figure and columns of $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{embd}}$ . We also delete both rows 4 ). and columns of the matrix $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell-1}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ −

# 4 EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
Setup We use HuggingFace Transformers ( Wolf et al. ,2019 ) to implement our code with PyTorch (Paszke et al. ,2019 ). The computation of $\\mathbf{Q}$ is performed on a single H100 GPU with 80GB of memory, taking approximately 3.5 hours to complete for the L LAMA -2 70B model. During the PCA calculation, we use double precision for computing the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. We find that using single precision for eigenvector calculations in PyTorch leads to a discrepancy in the final accuracy, as detailed in Appendix A.2 .  

We experiment with two different calibration sets: 1024 samples from the WikiText-2 training dataset ( Merity et al. ,2016 ) and 5000 samples from the Alpaca training dataset ( Taori et al. ,2023 ). Sequence lengths are chosen as the maximum of each language model. An ablation study on the calibration set size and sequence length is presented in Appendix A.3 .  

Models, Tasks, and GPUs We evaluate all our experiments on OPT ( Zhang et al. ,2022 ), L LAMA -2 (Touvron et al. ,2023 ) model families, and additionally evaluate Phi-2 (in our zero-shot task) experiments. We exclude OPT 175B, as it is outperformed by smaller L LAMA -2 models. Nonetheless, we anticipate that this larger model will yield improved results, as larger models typically offer more promising opportunities for compression (see Section 4.1 ). We evaluate our scheme on both language generation as well as popular zero-shot tasks. To demonstrate the comprehensive speedup achieved by SliceGPT we use: Quadro RTX6000 GPUs with 24GB of memory as a representative example of consumer-level GPUs; 40GB A100s and 80GB H100s to provide datacenter-level benchmarks.  

Baseline Setup We initially planned to compare our results against a scheme that pruned columns (or rows) with the smallest norm but found that this baseline was very poor, with the perplexity of the model soaring into the 1000s after pruning just a few columns. Instead, we compare SliceGPT against SparseGPT ( Frantar & Alistarh ,2023 ) employing a 2:4 sparsity ratio, as this is the only sparsity scheme which achieves speedup ( Mishra et al. ,2021 ).",1>1

We evaluate the performance of PreNorm and PostNorm for ZST on various datasets and language pairs. We then analyze the off-target rates and structural discrepancies between PreNorm and PostNorm to understand performance differences.  

$$
\\mathrm{LayerNorm}(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{x})}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{V}(\\mathbf{x})}}\\cdot\\mathbf{g}+\\mathbf{b},
$$  

where $\\mathbf{g}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are trainable gain and bias. $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{V}$ indicate expectation and variance. LayerNorm is commonly used in two positions in the Transformer, as shown in Fig. 1 . PostNorm, which is the originally proposed setting of the Transformer ( Vaswani et al. ,2017 ), involves applying LayerNorm after each sub-module (i.e., selfattention or feed-forward network) and residual connections. PreNorm ( Baevski and Auli ,2019 ), on the other hand, involves applying LayerNorm directly before each sub-module and is known to stabilize Transformer training. While variants of Transformer LayerNorm like RMSNorm ( Zhang and Sennrich ,2019 ) have been proposed, the vanilla PreNorm and PostNorm are still the most widely adopted settings in current multilingual

# 3.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets We perform ZST experiments on three datasets: OPUS ( Zhang et al. ,2020 ), IWSLT ( Cettolo et al. ,2017 ), and Europarl ( Koehn ,2005 ). The statistics of the datasets are summarized in Table 1 .We include 7 ,4 , and 5 languages for each dataset. The training data consists of only English-centric sentence pairs, resulting in 30 ,6 , and 12 ZST directions for each dataset. The total number of parallel sentences for each dataset is 12 .00 M, 1 .38 M, and 15 .78 M, respectively. We apply BPE ( Sennrich et al. ,2016 ) with merge operations of 50 k, 40 k, and $50\\mathbf{k}$ to create a joint vocabulary for each dataset.  

Training We employ Transformer-base model for OPUS and IWSLT, and Transformer-big for Europarl, in accordance with the distinct sizes of training data. We consider the following settings: (1) PreNorm or PostNorm : PreNorm involves LayerNorm directly before each sub-module (i.e., self-attention or feed-forward network), while PostNorm applies LayerNorm after each sub-module and residual connections, as shown in Fig. 1 .(2) S-ENC-T-DEC or T-ENC : Source language tag on the encoder-side and target language tag on the decoder-side; or only target language tag on the encoder-side. Wu et al. (2021 ) showed that this setting impacts ZST for Transformer with PreNorm. (3) w/ or w/o Res. : With the residual connection for self-attention in the middle $(4^{t h})$ encoder layer or not. Liu et al. (2021 ) revealed that “w/o Res.” improves ZST for the model trained with PreNorm. We experiment this with different LayerNorm settings as this may reduce the potential of overfitting on supervised directions, then further impacts ZST, which aligns with our hypothesis.  

Table 2: BLEU scores and off-target rates (shown in brackets) . We report the average score of three seeds; refer to Appendix Gfor BLEU score of each translation direction and seed. “Res.” indicates the residual connection of self-attention in the $4^{t h}$ encoder layer. We mark lower off-target rates and significantly higher BLEU scores ( Koehn ,2004 ) between PreNorm and PostNorm in bold for ZST.

The settings above lead to eight different combinations, shown in Table 2 (#1 - #8). Additional training details are in Appendix A .

# 3.2 Main Results
We evaluate ZST systems using SacreBLEU ( Post ,2018 ) and off-target rates. We report in Table 2 BLEU scores for both zero-shot and supervised directions. For ZST, we also present pivot-based translation results as a reference. Implementation details of evaluation can be found in Appendix B.Our findings are as follows:  

PreNorm vs. PostNorm :We find that PostNorm consistently yields better BLEU scores than PreNorm for ZST across various language tag and residual connection settings, while their performance is comparable for supervised directions.  

Impact of Language Tag and Residual Connection: We observe that using the “T-ENC” language tag and “w/ Res.” improves ZST performance for IWSLT, which aligns with the findings of $\\mathrm{Wu}$ et al. (2021 ) and Liu et al. (2021 ). Nevertheless, the best performance is achieved using “w/ Res.” for PostNorm with “S-ENC-T-DEC” and “T-ENC” tags for OPUS and Europarl, respectively (#2 and #4). Given that Wu et al. (2021 ) and Liu et al. (2021 )used PreNorm as the default setting (#2, #4, #6 and #8 are unreported results in their work), our results emphasize the need to consider PostNorm as the default setting for ZST, while the language tag and residual connection settings have less impact.  

Off-target Rates : Off-target rates help understand the different BLEU score gaps between PreNorm and PostNorm, which ranges from 0 .5 to 12 .3 BLEU points. For PreNorm and PostNorm with the “T-ENC” language tag (#3, #4, #7, and #8), they have similar off-target rates, with a discrepancy ranging from $-0.61\\%$ to $2.02\\%$ , which results in narrow BLEU score gaps, ranging from 0 .5 to 1 .8 points. However, for PreNorm and PostNorm with the “S-ENC-T-DEC” language tag (#1, #2, #5, and #6), the off-target rates show a more considerable discrepancy, ranging from $5.40\\%$ to $54.23\\%$ , resulting in BLEU score gaps from 1 .7 to 12 .3 points. Further analysis of the nature of Transformer hidden states in the next section explores the reason for these different off-target rates in translations.",1>1

# 5.1 LAYER NORM TUNING A DAPTS LLM S TO MULTI -M ODAL
Influence of the Vision-Language Connector The vision-language connector serves as the converter to project features from the vision encoder to the LLM domain. In our previous experiments, we focused on finetuning the LLM component of the MLLMs while keeping the vision-language connector activated by default. To determine which component plays a more important role for domain adaptation of LLM to multi-modal domain, we performed an ablation study by activating the two components separately. Results are presented in table 4 , tuning LayerNorm in attention blocks without activating the vision-language connector resulted in only a $4.2\\%$ and $5.4\\%$ decrease in performance on three traditional multi-modal tasks and the MME benchmark, respectively. This decrease is significantly lower than the $15.6\\%$ and $9.2\\%$ downgrade observed when only activating the Connector on the same tasks. This observation highlights the vital role LayerNorm plays in transforming knowledge from the vision domain to language, indicating LayerNorm as a strong domain adaptor for the LLM architecture.

Switching Visual Features. We employ the ViT encoder from CLIP ( Radford et al. ,2021 ) by default in our previous experiments. CLIP ( Radford et al. ,2021 ) models are trained with image-text contrastive loss, thus its feature space is already aligned with language. Since LayerNorm has shown its effectiveness as a domain adaptor, we are interested in testing whether or not LayerNorm tuning can adapt a LLM to image features that are not pretrained to align with language. The vision encoder is switched to a ViT model that was pretrained on ImageNet (Dosovitskiy et al. ,2021 ;Deng et al. ,2009 ). Results in table 5 demonstrate that both LayerNorm and finetuning approaches can yield high performance. Interestingly, we observe that by LayerNorm tuning with ImageNet trained ViT, which has not been aligned with language, the model is able to achieve comparable performance to full parameter finetuning , i.e ., results show that LayerNorm tuning outperforms finetuning by $12.0\\%$ on captioning tasks, but performs slightly worse by $5.0\\%$ on the MME benchmark. These results again indicates the domain adaptor role of the LayerNorm , hinting the reason behind the empircal success of LayerNorm tuning. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the performance of MLLMs incorporating ViT pretrained on ImageNet is generally inferior to that of CLIP’s vision encoder. This observation provides compelling evidence that, despite differences in tokenizer and training paradigm between CLIP’s text encoder and LL A MA’s, ViT from CLIP has the capacity to learn general patterns of language formulation during pre-training. Thus, significantly enhance MLLM abilities.

# 5.2 LAYER NORM TUNING I MPROVES THE EXPRESSIVE POWER
It is shown in Pires et al. (2023 ) that a Transformer model incorporating anisotropic layer representation can capture a wider range of learning patterns. By computing the cosine similarities between all layers in the LLM of a finetuned MLLM, we aim to investigate whether the improved efficiency is the results of the improved expressive power. In table 6 , we present the average layer similarity of three 7B scale MLLMs, and in fig. 3 we present the visualization of per layer similarity scores of MM-V ICUNA -7B. Our analysis reveals that the transformer layers in the MLLMs with LayerNorm tuning exhibit a clear distinction from one another ( i.e ., an average $10.6\\%$ lower layer similarities comparing finetuning), indicating superior generalization ability and expressive power compared to finetuning. This finding sheds light on why tuning LayerNorm is effective for multi-modal LLM training. For additional visualizations, please refer to the Appendix A.2.1 .
