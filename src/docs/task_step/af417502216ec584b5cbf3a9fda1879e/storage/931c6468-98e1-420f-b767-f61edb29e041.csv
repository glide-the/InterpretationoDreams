Now that every LayerNorm in the transformer has been converted to RMSNorm, we can select any $\\mathbf{Q}$ to modify the model. Our initial plan was to collect signals from the model, construct an orthogonal matrix using those signals and to delete parts of the network. We quickly saw that the signals at different blocks of the network were not aligned, and that we would need to apply a different orthogonal matrix at each block, $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ .  

Allowing the orthogonal matrix used in each block to differ can be shown to leave the model unchanged using the same proof as Theorem 1 ,  

  
Figure 3: Converting a transformer network from LayerNorm to RMSNorm: the scale matrix diag $(\\alpha)$ is absorbed into the subsequent matrix $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ . Figure shows the block in combined colors. We use $(\\alpha)$ for brevity. The mean-subtraction matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is applied to each matrix $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{out}}$ . Layernorm becomes RMSNorm, up to a constant $\\bar{\\sqrt{D}}$ (not shown). Here, the scaling $(\\alpha^{\\prime})$ comes from the previous block.  

  
Figure 4: With the network converted to RMSNorm (see Figure 3 ), we apply the computational-invariance idea. The input weight matrices $\\mathrm{diag}(\\alpha)\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ are pre-multiplied by $\\mathbf{Q}^{\\top}$ . The output matrices $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{out}}\\mathbf{M}$ are post-multiplied by $\\mathbf{Q}$ . In the skip-connection, a new linear layer is added $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell+1}$ . After these modifications, the matrices can be sliced (hatched areas).  

with the exception of line 5 of Algorithm 1 . Here we see that the residual connection and the output of the block must have the same rotation. To fix this, we modify the residual connection by applying the linear transformation applied to different blocks with the additional linear operation in the residual connection. Unlike the $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell-1}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ −to the residual. Figure 4 shows how different rotations can be modifications to the weight matrices, these additional operations cannot be pre-computed and add a small $(D\\times D)$ overhead to the model. Nonetheless, they are needed to allow slicing the model (Section 3.4 ) and we see real speedup overall (Section 4 ).  

To compute the matrices $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ , we use PCA. We select a calibration dataset from the training set, run it through the model (after converting LayerNorm operations into RMSNorm), and extract the orthogonal matrix of the layer. We use the output of the transformed network to calculate the orthogonal matrices of the next layers. More precisely, if $\\mathbf{X}_{\\ell,i}$ is the output of the $\\ell^{\\mathrm{th}}$ RMSNorm block for the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ sequence in the calibration dataset, we compute  

$$
\\mathbf{C}_{\\ell}=\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{X}_{\\ell,i}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}_{\\ell,i}
$$  

and set $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ to the be the eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{C}_{\\ell}$ , sorted by decreasing eigenvalues.

# 3.4 SLICING
The goal of Principal Component Analysis is usually to take a data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and compute a lower dimensional representation $\\mathbf{Z}$ , and an approximate reconstruction $\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}$ :  

$$
\\mathbf{Z}=\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{D}\\,,\\qquad\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}=\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{D}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}^{\\top}\\,.
$$  

where $\\mathbf{Q}$ is the ectors of ${\\bf X}^{\\top}{\\bf X}$ , and $\\mathbf{D}$ is a $D\\times D_{\\mathrm{small}}$ deletion matrix (containing $D_{\\mathrm{small}}$ The reconstruction is columns of the $D\\times D$ ×$L_{2}$ identity matrix), which removes some of the columns of the matrix to the left. optimal, in the sense that QD is a linear mapping that minimizes $\\lVert\\mathbf{X}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\rVert^{2}$ .  

When we apply PCA to the signal matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ bween blocks, we never materialize the $N\\times D$ signal matrix, but we apply the deletion matrix Dto the operations preceding and succeeding the construction of that matrix, which have already been multiplied by $\\mathbf{Q}$ in the above. We delete rows of $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ that we have inserted into the residual connection (see Figure and columns of $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{embd}}$ . We also delete both rows 4 ). and columns of the matrix $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell-1}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}_{\\ell}$ −

# 4 EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
Setup We use HuggingFace Transformers ( Wolf et al. ,2019 ) to implement our code with PyTorch (Paszke et al. ,2019 ). The computation of $\\mathbf{Q}$ is performed on a single H100 GPU with 80GB of memory, taking approximately 3.5 hours to complete for the L LAMA -2 70B model. During the PCA calculation, we use double precision for computing the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. We find that using single precision for eigenvector calculations in PyTorch leads to a discrepancy in the final accuracy, as detailed in Appendix A.2 .  

We experiment with two different calibration sets: 1024 samples from the WikiText-2 training dataset ( Merity et al. ,2016 ) and 5000 samples from the Alpaca training dataset ( Taori et al. ,2023 ). Sequence lengths are chosen as the maximum of each language model. An ablation study on the calibration set size and sequence length is presented in Appendix A.3 .  

Models, Tasks, and GPUs We evaluate all our experiments on OPT ( Zhang et al. ,2022 ), L LAMA -2 (Touvron et al. ,2023 ) model families, and additionally evaluate Phi-2 (in our zero-shot task) experiments. We exclude OPT 175B, as it is outperformed by smaller L LAMA -2 models. Nonetheless, we anticipate that this larger model will yield improved results, as larger models typically offer more promising opportunities for compression (see Section 4.1 ). We evaluate our scheme on both language generation as well as popular zero-shot tasks. To demonstrate the comprehensive speedup achieved by SliceGPT we use: Quadro RTX6000 GPUs with 24GB of memory as a representative example of consumer-level GPUs; 40GB A100s and 80GB H100s to provide datacenter-level benchmarks.  

Baseline Setup We initially planned to compare our results against a scheme that pruned columns (or rows) with the smallest norm but found that this baseline was very poor, with the perplexity of the model soaring into the 1000s after pruning just a few columns. Instead, we compare SliceGPT against SparseGPT ( Frantar & Alistarh ,2023 ) employing a 2:4 sparsity ratio, as this is the only sparsity scheme which achieves speedup ( Mishra et al. ,2021 ).",3

We evaluate the performance of PreNorm and PostNorm for ZST on various datasets and language pairs. We then analyze the off-target rates and structural discrepancies between PreNorm and PostNorm to understand performance differences.  

$$
\\mathrm{LayerNorm}(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{x})}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{V}(\\mathbf{x})}}\\cdot\\mathbf{g}+\\mathbf{b},
$$  

where $\\mathbf{g}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are trainable gain and bias. $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{V}$ indicate expectation and variance. LayerNorm is commonly used in two positions in the Transformer, as shown in Fig. 1 . PostNorm, which is the originally proposed setting of the Transformer ( Vaswani et al. ,2017 ), involves applying LayerNorm after each sub-module (i.e., selfattention or feed-forward network) and residual connections. PreNorm ( Baevski and Auli ,2019 ), on the other hand, involves applying LayerNorm directly before each sub-module and is known to stabilize Transformer training. While variants of Transformer LayerNorm like RMSNorm ( Zhang and Sennrich ,2019 ) have been proposed, the vanilla PreNorm and PostNorm are still the most widely adopted settings in current multilingual

# 3.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets We perform ZST experiments on three datasets: OPUS ( Zhang et al. ,2020 ), IWSLT ( Cettolo et al. ,2017 ), and Europarl ( Koehn ,2005 ). The statistics of the datasets are summarized in Table 1 .We include 7 ,4 , and 5 languages for each dataset. The training data consists of only English-centric sentence pairs, resulting in 30 ,6 , and 12 ZST directions for each dataset. The total number of parallel sentences for each dataset is 12 .00 M, 1 .38 M, and 15 .78 M, respectively. We apply BPE ( Sennrich et al. ,2016 ) with merge operations of 50 k, 40 k, and $50\\mathbf{k}$ to create a joint vocabulary for each dataset.  

Training We employ Transformer-base model for OPUS and IWSLT, and Transformer-big for Europarl, in accordance with the distinct sizes of training data. We consider the following settings: (1) PreNorm or PostNorm : PreNorm involves LayerNorm directly before each sub-module (i.e., self-attention or feed-forward network), while PostNorm applies LayerNorm after each sub-module and residual connections, as shown in Fig. 1 .(2) S-ENC-T-DEC or T-ENC : Source language tag on the encoder-side and target language tag on the decoder-side; or only target language tag on the encoder-side. Wu et al. (2021 ) showed that this setting impacts ZST for Transformer with PreNorm. (3) w/ or w/o Res. : With the residual connection for self-attention in the middle $(4^{t h})$ encoder layer or not. Liu et al. (2021 ) revealed that “w/o Res.” improves ZST for the model trained with PreNorm. We experiment this with different LayerNorm settings as this may reduce the potential of overfitting on supervised directions, then further impacts ZST, which aligns with our hypothesis.  

Table 2: BLEU scores and off-target rates (shown in brackets) . We report the average score of three seeds; refer to Appendix Gfor BLEU score of each translation direction and seed. “Res.” indicates the residual connection of self-attention in the $4^{t h}$ encoder layer. We mark lower off-target rates and significantly higher BLEU scores ( Koehn ,2004 ) between PreNorm and PostNorm in bold for ZST.

The settings above lead to eight different combinations, shown in Table 2 (#1 - #8). Additional training details are in Appendix A .

# 3.2 Main Results
We evaluate ZST systems using SacreBLEU ( Post ,2018 ) and off-target rates. We report in Table 2 BLEU scores for both zero-shot and supervised directions. For ZST, we also present pivot-based translation results as a reference. Implementation details of evaluation can be found in Appendix B.Our findings are as follows:  

PreNorm vs. PostNorm :We find that PostNorm consistently yields better BLEU scores than PreNorm for ZST across various language tag and residual connection settings, while their performance is comparable for supervised directions.  

Impact of Language Tag and Residual Connection: We observe that using the “T-ENC” language tag and “w/ Res.” improves ZST performance for IWSLT, which aligns with the findings of $\\mathrm{Wu}$ et al. (2021 ) and Liu et al. (2021 ). Nevertheless, the best performance is achieved using “w/ Res.” for PostNorm with “S-ENC-T-DEC” and “T-ENC” tags for OPUS and Europarl, respectively (#2 and #4). Given that Wu et al. (2021 ) and Liu et al. (2021 )used PreNorm as the default setting (#2, #4, #6 and #8 are unreported results in their work), our results emphasize the need to consider PostNorm as the default setting for ZST, while the language tag and residual connection settings have less impact.  

Off-target Rates : Off-target rates help understand the different BLEU score gaps between PreNorm and PostNorm, which ranges from 0 .5 to 12 .3 BLEU points. For PreNorm and PostNorm with the “T-ENC” language tag (#3, #4, #7, and #8), they have similar off-target rates, with a discrepancy ranging from $-0.61\\%$ to $2.02\\%$ , which results in narrow BLEU score gaps, ranging from 0 .5 to 1 .8 points. However, for PreNorm and PostNorm with the “S-ENC-T-DEC” language tag (#1, #2, #5, and #6), the off-target rates show a more considerable discrepancy, ranging from $5.40\\%$ to $54.23\\%$ , resulting in BLEU score gaps from 1 .7 to 12 .3 points. Further analysis of the nature of Transformer hidden states in the next section explores the reason for these different off-target rates in translations.",3

Large-scale models have drawn significant attention for their remarkable performance across a spectrum of applications (Ramesh et al. 2022; Irwin et al. 2022; Lee et al. 2020). Considering that training large models from scratch requires tremendous computational costs, fine-tuning has become a predominant approach to transfer knowledge from large pretrained models to downstream tasks (Long et al. 2015; Guo et al. 2020). However, this paradigm heavily relies on labeled training data and suffers from significant performance decay when target data exhibits distribution shift from pretraining data (Ben-David et al. 2010). Moreover, we usually have multiple pretrained models trained on different sources or architectures on hand, e.g., medical diagnostic models trained on distinct regions or patient groups. Demands to maximally utilizing knowledge from multiple pretrained models are common in real world applications. To this end, Multi-Source-Free Domain Adaptation (MSFDA) (Ahmed et al. 2021; Dong et al. 2021) emerges as a promising technique to address these challenges by enabling holistic adaptation of multiple pretrained source models to an unlabeled target domain, while not accessing source training data.

Existing MSFDA methods (Ahmed et al. 2021; Dong et al. 2021; Han et al. 2023; Shen, Bu, and Wornell 2023) typically tackle the problem via a two-step framework, i.e., (1) Tune each source model thoroughly towards target domain, and (2) Learn source importance weights to assemble the source models. However, their overwhelming limitations in computational efficiency and scalability prevent their applications on large-scale problems. For step $(I)$ , the number of models to tune increases linearly along with the number of source domains, which could become unacceptable for large-scale problems with abundant source domains. The necessity of tuning all parameters for each model also makes it infeasible to scale up these methods to larger models. In Table 5 we compare the performance and trainable parameters of CAiDA (Dong et al. 2021), PMTrans 1 (Zhu, Bai, and Wang 2023) and our methods on a challenging benchmark DomainNet (Peng et al. 2019) with 6 domains. As a typical MSFDA framework, CAiDA performs poorly due to limited performance of ResNet-50 (He et al. 2016) backbone. By equipping a stronger backbone SwinTransformer (Liu et al. 2021), a potential performance boost of $+12.3\\%$ is achieved at a cost of four times of parameters to tune. On the other hand, we aim to achieve superior performance by equipping SwinTransformer while demanding significantly less training cost, presenting a more feasible and agile solution for MSFDA on large models. For step (2) , current MSFDA methods learn domain-level ensemble weights, applying identical ensemble strategy across all target instances. Although the learned weights are intuitively interpretable in terms of domain transferablity, they unavoidably introduce misalignment and bias at instance-level. This controversy inherently introduces a trade-off between instance specificity and domain consistency of ensemble weights, which has not been well exploited by existing methods.  

  
Figure 1: Illustration of instance specificity and domain consistency. Dots are weights assigned to each target sample.  

Recent success of model ensemble methods (Shu et al. 2021, 2022) suggests that it is effective to transfer knowledge by designing adaptive ensemble weights. While optimal strategies are hard to learn (Mohammed and Kora 2023), we resort to slight tuning of several domain-specific bottleneck layers, costing less than $0.1\\%$ of tuning the whole model. As stated above, the key to designing effective weights is to exploit both domain-level transferabilities and instance-level individual characteristics, as illustrated by Fig. 8. Existing MSFDA methods learn weights solely from feature representations, neglecting the potential transferability mismatch between features and outputs, i.e., transferable target features do not always lead to accurate predictions. To address this issue, we propose to introduce additional semantic information from classifiers for deriving weights. For each feature representation, we first learn intra-domain weights to mitigate transferability mismatch by finding the most compatible classifier that produces unbiased outputs. With unbiased outputs from the selected source classifier, we further learn inter-domain ensemble weights that combine source outputs into the final result. We propose a novel Bilevel ATtention ENsemble (Bi-ATEN) to effectively learn the two weights through attention mechanisms. Bi-ATEN is capable of tailoring its ensemble decisions to the particularities of each instance, while maintaining the broader transferability trends that are consistent across domains. This balance is essential for accurate domain adaptation, where a model needs to leverage domain-specific knowledge without losing the overarching patterns that drive adaptation.  

The proposed Bi-ATEN can be simplified into interdomain ATtention ENsemble (ATEN) and plugged into existing MSFDA methods by replacing their weight-learning module. Although leaning towards domain consistency in the specificity-consistency balance, ATEN still exhibits clear performance boost over baseline methods, proving the efficacy of our design. In a nutshell, we achieve adaptation primarily by assuring instance specificity and domain consistency along with slight tuning of bottlenecks. Table 5 provides comprehensive comparison between our methods and existing methods. Our contributions can be summarized as: (1) We propose a novel framework to agilely handle MSFDA by learning fine-grained domain adaptive ensemble strategies. (2) We design an effective module Bi-ATEN that learns both intra-domain weights and inter-domain ensemble weights. Its light version ATEN can be equipped to existing MSFDA methods to boost performance. (3) Our method significantly reduces computational costs while achieving state-of-the-art performance, making it feasible for real-life transfer applications with large source-trained models. (4) Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks and detailed analysis demonstrates the success of our design.",3
