However, without specific details on their notice periods or the flexibility of their current projects, it is difficult to determine with certainty who is the most likely to join. If I had to make an educated guess, I would say that Song Jinke, being involved in academic research, might have more control over his schedule and could be the most likely to join within a month.\n\nAnswer: Based on the information available, Song Jinke seems to be the most likely candidate to join the company within a month, assuming his research projects can be managed accordingly.

This project is inspired by the theory of dream analysis in psychoanalysis and aims to deconstruct the user's psychological state and issues through the combination of LLM and thought chains. It utilizes modules such as audio and video parsing, data processing, scenario template generator, scene file loader, and dialogue loader. The project has implemented features like emotion-driven representation, scenario information named entity recognition (NER) extraction, story scenario generation, emotional scenario guidance, plot summary, personality analysis, and scenario role-playing. This allows downstream users to engage in code-free dream interpretation and psychological guidance.\n\nIn terms of potential technological breakthroughs, the project's design and implementation of a conversation loader demonstrate an innovative approach. By abstracting each code block of langchain, a code generator was built, making it more practical and simpler to use after applying the data module concept. Additionally, the custom memory module designed in different forms provides key indicators for collaborative analysis of subsequent action decision-making and environmental perception tasks, enhancing the explainability and credibility of human behavior."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thought: Based on the information gathered from Zhang Maofeng's resume, the Interpretation of Dreams project involving LLM shows a high potential for technological breakthroughs.

This project is inspired by the theory of dream analysis in psychoanalysis and aims to deconstruct the user's psychological state and issues through the combination of LLM and thought chains. It utilizes modules such as audio and video parsing, data processing, scenario template generator, scene file loader, and dialogue loader. The project has implemented features like emotion-driven representation, scenario information named entity recognition (NER) extraction, story scenario generation, emotional scenario guidance, plot summary, personality analysis, and scenario role-playing. This allows downstream users to engage in code-free dream interpretation and psychological guidance.\n\nIn terms of potential technological breakthroughs, the project's design and implementation of a conversation loader demonstrate an innovative approach. By abstracting each code block of langchain, a code generator was built, making it more practical and simpler to use after applying the data module concept. Additionally, the custom memory module designed in different forms provides key indicators for collaborative analysis of subsequent action decision-making and environmental perception tasks, enhancing the explainability and credibility of human behavior."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thought: Based on the information gathered from Zhang Maofeng's resume, the Interpretation of Dreams project involving LLM shows a high potential for technological breakthroughs.

Additionally, their involvement in the design and implementation of the iSafe identity and access management solution suggests familiarity with middleware that handles authentication and authorization processes. The candidate has also worked on projects that involve the Maven and Github ecosystems, where middleware could be used to manage dependencies and facilitate the build process. Their use of NLP technologies, such as RNN and NER, to match security reports with software packages and device information implies a level of expertise in middleware that handles data processing and integration. Overall, while the resume does not explicitly mention middleware, the candidate's project experience suggests practical knowledge in this area."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Action: resume_zhangmaofeng\nAction Input: {'input': \"Please provide details about the candidate's experience with middleware.\"}"}]}

He was involved in designing and implementing the project, starting from the initial 0.1 version where he proposed a unified and general loading method for local LLMs. This solution addressed the complexity of initializing various models and ensured simplified coupling between the framework and upper-level businesses.\n\nIn the project, Zhang Maofeng was responsible for implementing the business logic of model dialogue, including the streaming interaction logic of langchain's custom Chain and loader. He resolved the issue of different prompt control vocabulary definitions among various models by encapsulating these differences, which significantly reduced coding work through unified encoding for upper-level business in the dialogue process.\n\nHe led the iteration of version 0.2, where he focused on implementing a feasible solution for RAG model Q&A and vector interaction. He optimized the knowledge base recall and Q&A matching by designing a summary rule and Agent logic, which improved the model's accuracy in single-round dialogues by 30 percentage points.\n\nFor the 0.3 iteration, Zhang Maofeng took charge of designing and researching a universal loading framework for large language models and multi-modal models, including distributed plugin registration and interaction logic. This involved creating a distributed message framework to subscribe and process plugins in a distributed manner, solving the loading issues of various capability models in the original project and adapting it for multi-modal models.\n\nHis skills related to langchain and project participation include:\n\n- Designing and implementing Q&A solutions using langchain.\n- Developing unified loading methods for local LLMs.\n- Streamlining dialogue interaction logic and prompt control.\n- Enhancing knowledge base recall and Q&A matching performance.\n- Creating distributed plugin frameworks for model loading.\n- Managing project lifecycle, from research and design to testing and maintenance.\n\nThese experiences demonstrate Zhang Maofeng's proficiency in langchain technology and his ability to lead and contribute effectively to complex projects."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thought: Based on Zhang Maofeng's extensive experience and skills with langchain technology and project implementation, he is the more likely candidate to participate in a domestic project that utilizes langchain thinking.\nAnswer: Zhang Maofeng is more likely to participate in a domestic project that utilizes langchain thinking, given his comprehensive experience and skills in langchain technology and project management."}]}

This project utilizes the langchain concept to create a local knowledge base-based Q&A application. The goal is to establish a friendly solution for Chinese scenarios and open-source models that can run offline. The project supports the use of open-source LLM (Large Language Model) and Embedding models, allowing for offline private deployment using only open-source models. Additionally, it also supports the integration of OpenAI GPT API and plans to continuously expand support for various models and model APIs. Zhang was responsible for designing and implementing a unified loading method for local LLMs, solving the complexity of model initialization. He also worked on the business logic of model dialogue, addressing issues related to prompt control vocabulary differences between different models. He led the iteration for designing a universal loading framework for large language models and multi-modal models, including distributed plugin registration and interaction logic.

This is done to improve performance, scalability, and fault tolerance. When designing the rules for knowledge base sharding and the logic for the agents that interact with these shards, the following considerations are important:\n\n1. Consistent Sharding Criteria: Establish clear criteria for how knowledge is divided among shards. This could be based on topic, category, alphabet, or any other relevant attribute that ensures data is evenly distributed and allows for efficient querying.\n\n2. Hashing or Partitioning Algorithm: Use a robust hashing or partitioning algorithm to determine which shard a piece of knowledge belongs to. This ensures that the distribution is uniform and that the agent logic can consistently locate the required information.\n\n3. Load Balancing: Implement load balancing mechanisms to distribute the workload evenly across shards. This prevents overloading certain shards while others remain underutilized.\n\n4. Fault Tolerance: Design the system to handle the failure of a shard without losing data or availability. This might involve replication or mirroring of shards across different servers or data centers.\n\n5. Query Routing: Agents should have logic to route queries to the correct shard. This can be achieved through a lookup table, a routing service, or by incorporating the sharding logic within the agent itself.\n\n6. Scalability: Ensure that the sharding design allows for easy scaling. As the knowledge base grows, new shards can be added without significant downtime or data restructuring.\n\n7. Data Consistency: Maintain consistency across shards, especially when updates or deletions occur. This might require implementing distributed transactions or using a consensus algorithm to ensure all shards reflect the latest state of the knowledge base.\n\n8. Agent Logic for Shard Management: Agents should be aware of the sharding strategy and be able to adapt their logic to changes in the shard configuration. This includes being able to determine when to read from or write to a particular shard.\n\n9. Monitoring and Maintenance: Regularly monitor the performance and health of shards. Agents should be equipped to handle maintenance tasks such as re-balancing, compacting, or migrating shards as needed.\n\n10. Security and Access Control: Ensure that access to shards is controlled and that agents adhere to security protocols. This includes managing permissions and encryption keys that might be shard-specific.\n\nBy following these design rules and incorporating the appropriate agent logic, a knowledge base sharding system can be efficient, scalable, and reliable."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thought: The observation from the resume_liulijian tool provides a detailed explanation of the considerations involved in the design of knowledge base sharding summary rules and Agent logic.

This allowed plugins to run on different machines in a reasonable, efficient, and integrated way, overcoming the drawbacks of the original project's model loading approach.\n\nThis new framework was particularly important for adapting to multi-modal models and ensuring that the project could continue to evolve with the community's main efforts while enhancing expressiveness and efficiency.

The project differentiates between basic components and business components, which is a key aspect of componentization. However, without specific details on the implementation, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the project has achieved modularization and its compatibility with different business requirements. It appears that the project is moving towards better structure and flexibility, but there may still be ongoing work to fully realize a modular and componentized system that can seamlessly accommodate diverse business needs."}]}

This is evident in the development of products like Ban Niu Cloud Spreadsheet and the Visualized Dashboard.\n\nFor the Ban Niu Cloud Spreadsheet, the team initially aimed to create a product that was feature-rich and capable of online collaboration, similar to Excel. However, they encountered challenges such as data loss, misalignment, and performance issues. In response, they adapted by modularizing the product. They cut down on less commonly used features and focused on synchronizing collaboration at the data level, demonstrating an ability to pivot and tailor the product to the resources available and the specific needs of the business.\n\nIn the case of the Visualized Dashboard, the second version was designed with a combination of offline and stream computing, which shows a modular approach to handling data processing. This design allowed for scalability and adaptability to handle peak loads, like during the Double 11 shopping festival. The modular componentization of the dashboard's data\u541e\u5410\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387 (data throughput and analysis efficiency) indicates an effort to meet varying business demands effectively.\n\nLiu's experience with Ban Niu and the subsequent creation of Leiniao 365 reflect a deep understanding of the importance of adaptability. Leiniao 365 was conceptualized to lower the technical complexity and barriers to entry for data utilization. The product is designed to be modular and adaptable to different business needs, as evidenced by its various features:\n\n1. It operates as a database with an Excel interface, which is familiar and user-friendly.\n2. The super spreadsheet has no limit on single-table data volume, catering to different scales of data handling.\n3. It provides AP tools that can calculate formulas involving hundreds of millions of data points in seconds.\n4. Real-time data synchronization with built-in data tables is a feature that ensures up-to-date information for decision-making.\n5. Support for standard SQL statements allows for flexibility in data querying and manipulation.\n6. Data flow ETL capabilities mean that all spreadsheet data can be interconnected, which is essential for adapting to various data integration needs.\n7. The ability to connect to other data systems through standard database drivers shows the product's interoperability and adaptability to diverse technical environments.\n\nThe inclusion of pre-trained models and generative models, which reduce the need for users to create templates and formulas themselves, further enhances the adaptability of Leiniao 365 to the needs of different businesses. This approach to product development highlights Liu's focus on creating modular components that can be adapted and scaled according to the specific requirements of his target market."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thought: Both Zhang Maofeng and Liu Lijian have demonstrated experience with modular componentization and adaptability to different business needs. However, Liu Lijian's experience with creating products like Leiniao 365 and Ban Niu Cloud Spreadsheet seems to more explicitly emphasize the development of modular components that can be easily adapted and scaled for various business requirements.\nAnswer: Liu Lijian is more likely to have achieved modular componentization and demonstrated the ability to adapt to different business needs in his project experience. His focus on creating user-friendly, modular products like Leiniao 365 and Ban Niu Cloud Spreadsheet shows a strong commitment to flexibility and customization, which are key aspects of component-based design."}]}

One such example is from the langchain-chatchat project, where he was responsible for providing openaiendpoint plugin services. By utilizing the openaiplugins module components, he achieved a high level of componentization, which in turn enhanced the project's business compatibility.\n\nThe componentized approach allowed for the preservation of the community's main work while also improving expressiveness and efficiency. This was made possible by designing a distributed message framework that facilitated the subscription processing mechanism for distributed plugins. As a result, different plugins could operate in a distributed manner on node machines, solving the issues of model loading in the original project and adapting to multi-modal models.\n\nAnother instance of componentization and business compatibility can be seen in the Interpretation of Dreams project, where Zhang Maofeng designed a conversation loader that abstracted each code block of langchain. This abstraction led to the creation of a code generator, which simplified the application data module and made it more practical and easy to use.\n\nFurthermore, in the KM platform project, Zhang Maofeng worked on knowledge classification and knowledge label management. By supporting various types of labels and intelligent generation of labels through content recognition, the project achieved a high degree of business compatibility.

This involved staying up-to-date with the latest models and APIs, like OpenAI GPT API, and incorporating them into our project.\n\nDuring the design and implementation stages, I worked with a team to create a unified loading method for local LLMs, which simplified the initialization process for various models. I also developed business logic for model dialogues and handled the complexities of prompt control vocabulary differences between models.\n\nIn terms of maintenance and iterative development, I led the 0.2 iteration where I optimized the knowledge base recall and\u95ee\u7b54matching, resulting in a 30-point increase in response accuracy. For the 0.3 iteration, I designed a distributed plugin registration and interaction logic to accommodate multi-modal models and improve the efficiency of model loading.\n\nFurthermore, I was responsible for project management tasks, including progress planning, requirement communication, design documentation, and architecture design, particularly focusing on microservices and common components.\n\nIn the maintenance phase, I was involved in the upgrade and maintenance of systems such as the provincial overhaul ultra-high voltage production command and control system. This included adapting to changes in data interfaces, ensuring compatibility with existing systems, and handling data maintenance for various business operations.\n\nLastly, I contributed to the development and deployment of a mobile application for intelligent operation inspection, which involved using H5 and the uniapp framework for deployment on a third-party platform.

This project was inspired by the psychoanalytic theory of dreams and aimed to analyze users' psychological states and issues through the deconstruction of dream content using LLM (Large Language Model) and thought chain combinations. The project encompassed various modules such as audio and video processing, data processing, scenario template generation, scene file loading, and dialogue loading. It featured functionalities like emotion-driven representation, scenario information Named Entity Recognition (NER) extraction, story generation, emotional guidance, plot summary, personality analysis, and role-playing.\n\nIn terms of project design and implementation stages, the individual responsible for this project was involved in the entire lifecycle, including research, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. This indicates a comprehensive understanding of the project's progression from initial conception to its final deployment and management.\n\nAnother project that showcases this understanding is the langchain-chatchat 21KStar. It was the first project in China to utilize the langchain concept for a knowledge-based question-and-answer application. This project aimed to create a friendly solution for Chinese scenarios and open-source models, which could be run offline. The project involved loading files, reading text, segmenting text, vectorizing text, question vectorization, matching the topk similar vectors, and generating answers using LLM.\n\nThe person responsible for this project was actively involved in the design and implementation stages. They proposed a unified and generic loading method for local LLMs in the initial 0.1 version, solving complex initialization issues for various models. They were also responsible for implementing the business logic of model conversations, customizing langchain framework chains and loaders, and solving the problem of different prompt control vocabulary definitions between models. Furthermore, they led the design and research of a general loading framework for large language models and multi-modal models in the 0.3 iteration, addressing the limitations of the previous model loading framework.\n\nThese projects demonstrate a clear understanding of the stages involved in project design and implementation, from initial concept and research to iterative development and final deployment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thought: Both Song Jinke and Zhang Maofeng have demonstrated a deep understanding of project design to implementation stages. However, the nature of their projects differs, with Song Jinke's projects being more focused on security analysis and Zhang Maofeng's on software development and AI applications. The choice between them would depend on the specific requirements of the position. If the position requires expertise in security analysis and privacy, Song Jinke might be more suitable. If the position is more focused on software development and AI, Zhang Maofeng could be the better fit.\nAnswer: Both Song Jinke and Zhang Maofeng are suitable candidates with a deep understanding of project design to implementation stages, but their areas of expertise differ.
